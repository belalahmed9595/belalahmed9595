## About
I started to code when I was 11, There I learned how to build websites using Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Python. After sometime I got into Tkinter with Python and from that, spent few months writing Desktop Graphical User Interface Applications with Tkinter. Then after sometime, I got into Android Development with Java. As of now, I am designing and developing few Android applications.
